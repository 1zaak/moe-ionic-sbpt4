# Official Malaysian Ministry of Education App
This project was developed using Ionic with a [Meteor backend](https://github.com/1zaak/moe-server-sbpt4). The sole feature of this app is to verify any current student's application to the nation's boarding school. It is also at the same time a useful lesson in proper Hybrid Mobile Application technologies for the government.
